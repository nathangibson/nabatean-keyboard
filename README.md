# Nabatean Keyboard Layout
A basic Mac keyboard layout for typing Nabatean characters from the Unicode range 10880—108AF. This layout uses the preinstalled layout "Syriac – Arabic" as a starting point, so the placement of equivalent consonants should be familiar to those who type Arabic or Syriac.

<mark>**⚠️ This keyboard layout merely provide a method to insert the characters currently in the Unicode range for Nabatean.** It does not provide any additional characters or features. Specifically, **connecting letters are a feature of the Nabatean script but typed characters cannot be connected.** This keyboard layout does not provide any way to connect letters, since (as far as I know), Unicode and font support for connecting letters in Nabatean is currently lacking.</mark>

This layout was created with the [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) keyboard layout editor.

**Note:** Access final consonants and the numbers 20 and 100 by pressing the `Shift` key.
