# Nabatean Keyboard Layout
A basic Mac keyboard layout for typing Nabatean characters from the Unicode range 10880—108AF. This layout uses the preinstalled layout "Syriac – Arabic" as a starting point, so the placement of equivalent consonants should be familiar to those who type Arabic or Syriac.

**Note:** Access final consonants by pressing the `Shift` key.
## Getting Started
**Mac OS:** 
 1. Download the file "nabatean" (.bundle) and copy it to either `"~/Library/Keyboard Layouts"` or `"/Library/Keyboard Layouts"`.
 2. Go to System Preferences > Keyboards > Input Sources. Click the + button and select "Aramaic (Nabatean)" from the list. Click "Add". All done!

**Windows:** A Windows version is not yet available.
